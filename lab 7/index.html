                    Hi! I'm Danielle. My whole life, I've loved photography. What fascinates me the most, is the ability to capture a moment and freeze it in time. I decided to pursue my passion for photography in college. The knowledge I gained about the technique and art of photography truly propelled my interest to new heights. Photography has greatly impacted and changed our world. I look forward to adding my work to this revolutionary collection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My love behind the lens comes forth in my photography. To me, "Photography is life's elegance preserved in the most beautiful format."
